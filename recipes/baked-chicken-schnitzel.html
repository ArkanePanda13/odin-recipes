        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Think you can't make chicken schnitzel without frying? Think again! This baked recipe imitates that deep-fried feel without using a ton of oil. All you need is to employ a couple simple hacks — heat the pan beforehand and drizzle the chicken with olive oil twice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Unlike traditional schnitzel, this recipe isn't deep-fried in oil. However, you'll still need to grease the pan with a little olive oil — it'll add flavor and keep the chicken from sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: Chicken breasts are cut in half lengthwise and flattened with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour works with the eggs and seasoned bread crumbs to make a crunchy, crispy breading.</li>
            <li><strong>Paprika</strong>: Paprika lends a smoky flavor to this chicken schnitzel recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Two whole eggs hold the breading together and helps it stick to the chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoned Bread Crumbs</strong>: You can use store-bought bread crumbs panko, or you can make your own seasoned bread crumbs at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Zest</strong>: The zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the crunchy breading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.</li>
            <li>Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the pan, then drizzle with more oil. Bake the chicken for five or six minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
